Welcome to my (awesome) [Neovim][neovim] setup![^1] Here you'll find the
configuration for the editor that I use as my daily driver.

## Installation

> [!WARNING]
> Install requires Neovim 0.9+. Always review the code before installing a
> configuration.

<details>
  <summary>
    If you're just looking to try out the configuration, see here.
  </summary>

  Clone the repository and install the plugins:

  ```sh
  git clone https://git.zakhary.dev/nvim ~/.config/kaplanz/nvim
  NVIM_APPNAME=kaplanz/nvim nvim --headless +"Lazy! sync" +qa
  ```

  Open Neovim with this config:

  ```sh
  NVIM_APPNAME=kaplanz/nvim nvim
  ```

</details>

Installation is as simple as cloning this repository into your Neovim home:

```sh
git clone https://git.zakhary.dev/nvim ~/.config/nvim
```

Then, install plugins using [lazy.nvim][lazy]:

```sh
nvim --headless +"Lazy! sync" +qa
```

... and that's it! You should now be ready to hack away.

### Updating

To keep up-to-date, regularly `git pull` this repository. Note that after a
pull, new plugins should install automatically when Neovim is next opened.

## Usage

### Plugins

Plugins are managed using [lazy.nvim][lazy]. To update a plugin, open and run:

```vim
Lazy update <plugin>
```

Or, to update all plugins:

```vim
Lazy update
```

### LSP

Language servers can be installed using [mason.nvim][mason]. For more
information, see mason.nvim's [help][mason.help].

In general, LSP should automatically launch for installed servers upon opening a
file. Neovim may need to be restarted after install for the first time.
